# Short about the project

City of Lodz, is the final project for the course FEND in the udacity.com. 
The aim was to build a map of Neighborhood in React.

The app was build from scratch, I had to use API from Google Maps + one more API, for the info window. I choose the Foursquare API.

The app, should be responsive, accessibility and working in the offline first rule. 


## How to use it?

Clone or copy the repo on your computer
run npm install 
run npm start

on the http://localhost:3000/ you can see places chosen by me. 

The offline first rule works in production build. To use it, please:
  npm run serve
and follow the instructions.

### IMPORTANT ###

It is possible that you will see the alert of problems with Google Maps API according to daily requests from this API. Despite this it is still possible to use the application.


### Others

The project wasn't easy for me. 
React is actually the first Framework that I have worked with, Ember or Angular I know only from theory :) 
This is the second project I build in react, and the first project build from scratch
I was looking for the help across the udacity courses - Goolemaps API, React;
I was searching in the internet f.e.: https://typeofweb.com/2017/11/28/wprowadzenie-kurs-react-js/

I was also watching webinars to this project, and many more. 
Thank you all and hope you will enjoy it.
